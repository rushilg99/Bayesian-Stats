I have recently been looking through C. Davidson-Pilon's book "Bayesian Methods for Hackers", which provides a rather practical approach to Bayesian inference and MCMC.
This book complemented my own theoretical study in Bayesian inference and I am glad to have read it.
The only information that I use from the book are the datasets that I have obtained from the book's GitHub repository.
I do this to test my understanding in Bayesian statistical inference and it can only help me get to grips with the pymc3 module in Python!
Furthermore, I have extended what was covered in the book to address an additional (observational) approach whereby I consider 2 different exponential rate parameters.
