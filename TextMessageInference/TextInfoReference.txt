I have recently been looking through C. Davidson-Pilon's book "Bayesian Methods for Hackers", which provides a rather practical approach to Bayesian inference and MCMC.
I got the text message data used in the Jupyter Notebook in this folder from the above book.
I have additionally extended what was covered in the book to address an additional approach whereby I consider 2 different exponential rate parameters.
