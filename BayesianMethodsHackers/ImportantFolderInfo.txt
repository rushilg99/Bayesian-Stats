I have recently been looking through C. Davidson-Pilon's book "Bayesian Methods for Hackers", which provides a rather practical approach to Bayesian inference and MCMC.
This book complemented my own theoretical study in Bayesian inference and I am glad to have read it.
In this folder, I take some of the datasets that were used and write code to analyse/infer from the data myself, without guidance from the aforementioned book.
The only information that I use from the book are the datasets that I have obtained from the book's GitHub repository.
I do this to test my understanding in Bayesian statistical inference and it can only help me get to grips with the pymc3 module in Python!
