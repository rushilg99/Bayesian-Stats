In the 2019/20 academic year, I took Professor Wilfrid Kendall's ST220 Introduction to Mathematical Statistics module at the University of Warwick. The focus was on likelihood methods
and traditional statistical inference, which I thoroughly enjoyed. This prompted me to research the area a bit further, which led me to read a little bit about Bayesian inference,
through Peter Hoff's First Course in Bayesian Statistical Methods. 

This repository contains a number of Jupyter notebooks related to Bayesian inference, from the basics of calculating posterior distributions to more complicated tasks involving mixture models
or inference of distribution parameters based on count data.
